# Art Portfolio
A responsive portfolio website for Toronto-born, Brooklyn-based artist Sarah Nicole Phillips (me). The site includes a biography, cv, image gallery with a nifty masonry layout and interactive image modal. The art information is stored in an array of objects. This site was not designed to be customizable however anyone can tweak it to suit their needs.
